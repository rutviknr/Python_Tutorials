    "# Execute Python Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Your Name>python myfile.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "        print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "        print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has no command for declaring a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments start with a `#`, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment.\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n"
